# Detaxizer_extension
## Welcome to my own Detaxizer extension
This project is based on my bachelor thesis, where my goal was to find sufficent nf-core based pipeline, which is possible to edit and implement new porcesses, specially to find contaminations in sequacing data adn create HTML page report about sample.
All files you can find here are not part of the original Detaxizer pipeline, but will help you to implement my process to pipeline and I will provide here to you a little guid how to do so.
But first, please be sure your Detaxize pipeline is installed correctly.
